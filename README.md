# [github.com/anup-2s/haskell-gaming] (Haskell Gaming Platform)

A gaming platform written entirely in Haskell, because why not.

Very much WIP, assume all APIs will change and none of the code is tested unless otherwise shown/specified.

Will try and version appropriately, once it becomes prudent to do so.

Not actively maintaining, so bear with me. Will write documentation as documentation lends itself to be written.
